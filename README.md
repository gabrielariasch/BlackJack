# BlackJack

The code is a basic example of a blackjack game in Python. It creates a deck of cards, deals two cards to each player, and then allows the player to take more cards until they either bust (go over 21) or stand (choose not to take any more cards). The dealer then takes cards until their score is at least 17. The player with the highest score wins.
